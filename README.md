Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are transforming the manufacturing industry. According to the report released by World Economic Forum, these technologies will play significant roles in the fourth industrial revolution. Major areas which can be benefited from this are:
Maintenance Department
Production Department
Supply Chain Department

Deep learning has been proven to be superior in detecting and localizing defects using imagery data which could significantly improve the production efficiency in the manufacturing industry.
